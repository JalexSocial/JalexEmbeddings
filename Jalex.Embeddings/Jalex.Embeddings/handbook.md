**ALMA MATER**

**All Hail, Alma Mater**

(Original)

The arch with its keystone our symbol of strength, The hills where the green forests grow,

And the Delaware Forks bring a message of old, Where the great rivers murmuring flow.

Chorus

All Hail! Alma Mater, the pride of our hearts, Easton High School, our high school so dear,

We pledge to your welfare the strength of our lives, Now and ever as year passes year.

**EASTON AREA HIGH SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION![](Aspose.Words.c8e98ed9-c8fc-408f-b6d8-ac828b163a8f.002.png)**

**Head Principal** Mr. Kyle Geiger **Deputy Principal** Ms. Jeanette Kassis

**ACADEMICS**

**ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS**

The curriculum offerings at EAHS are very diverse. These offerings are designed to meet the requests of our students in a comprehensive high school setting, yet still satisfy the criteria established by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. These basic requirements are designed with the philosophy that EAHS exists to prepare the students for their future in society. In addition, enough freedom of choice is built into the curriculum to allow for individual interests.

Students in grades 9-11 must maintain 7 credits each year (3.5 each semester) on their schedule to meet requirements. Students in grade 12 must maintain 6 credits. Seniors must have 3 credits during semester 1 and 3 credits during semester 2. Full year courses count as a half credit each semester. Students enrolled in off-campus courses may ask to waive this policy if it conflicts with outside scheduling.

**AUDITING COURSES**

Seniors can request to audit an elective, non-graduation required sixth major course. This is contingent upon approval of the senior principal and teacher involved. No grades or credit will be awarded.

**BELL SCHEDULE**

The bell schedule will be as follows:



<table><tr><th colspan="1"><b>Block</b></td><th colspan="1"><b>Period</b></td><th colspan="1"><b>Start</b></td><th colspan="1"><b>End</b></td><th colspan="1"><b>Minutes</b></td></tr>

**CHEATING AND PLAGIARISM**

Cheating and/or plagiarism of any type will result in failure of the test and/or paper of the person cheating and possibly the person giving information voluntarily under test conditions. Inappropriate Internet use to access, copy, give and/or sell material to another party will result in a zero (**0)** for the grade. Students must be familiar with the copyright and Internet use policies of the Easton Area School District. Seniors may lose privileges. Teachers will contact parents for any incident.

**CLASS RANK**

Class rank is determined by computing a general average derived from grades at the end of each marking period. It is cumulative beginning with the first quarter of 9th grade and ending with the final grades in grade 12. Advanced Placement courses are weighted 9% of all grades 60 through 100; Honors courses are weighted 6% of all grades 60 through 100. Class rank is calculated each marking period and at the end of the year. All courses are included in rank and GPA calculation except for physical education, Junto, and Rechauffe.

**DUAL ENROLLMENT**

Easton Area High School has dual enrollment agreements with several local colleges and universities. Dual Enrollment allows high school juniors and seniors to enroll in college-level courses and receive both secondary and postsecondary credit for that coursework. Dual enrollment is open to students who have a GPA of 83% or higher and be a student in good standing. Students can enroll in a maximum of two dual enrollment courses per semester. Dual enrollment classes cannot interfere with high school classes without prior administrative approval. Courses taken through dual enrollment cannot be counted as core subject requirements. Transportation and tuition is the responsibility of the parent/guardian. Courses taken over the summer cannot be counted for credit or used for student advancement in course requirements.

**GRADING**

Students are evaluated in each class depending upon a number of factors. A student’s grade is determined by the nature of the course, the curriculum, and course and department requirements. Grades will be posted as follows:

100 - 90 A

80 - 89 B

70  - 79 C

60  - 69 D

Below 60 F \*No Credit Awarded

Passing P

Final examinations/projects will be given in all subjects. In the case of semester courses, the exam will be given at the end of the semester.

1. The final grade for a semester course will consist of two marking periods. Each marking period will count as 45% of the final grade. The final exam will count as 10% of the final grade.
1. The final grade for a full year course will comprise four marking periods and a final exam. Each marking period will count as 22.5% and the final exam will count as 10% of the final grade.

**GRADUATION**

The following are the minimum requirements for graduation:

4 units in English – one unit each year

4 units in Social Studies – one unit each year

3 units in Science – one unit each year (Biology required)

3 units in Mathematics – (3 math classes)

2 units in Physical Education 0.5 units in Health 8 units in Electives

*Job Shadowing Experience and submission of assignments must be completed by the end of junior year.*

Each student must accumulate a minimum of 24.5 credits in order to earn a diploma. Any student who does not attend graduation practice will not be permitted to participate in the graduation ceremony. Any student not receiving a diploma will not be permitted to participate in commencement exercises.

**INDEPENDENT STUDY**

Independent study runs outside of the regular schedule, is not guaranteed, and cannot be taken for core graduation requirements. Students are eligible to complete one elective class per year as an independent study. Any student interested in taking an elective class as an independent study must first discuss the option with the school counselor. It is the student’s responsibility to find a teacher willing to provide an independent study. From there, the student will need to receive written permission from the teacher as to how they will work together to complete the class. Students must submit the plan in writing for principal approval. Once approved, the student will submit a plan to the counselor. Teachers are not required to do an independent study with students. If a teacher grants an independent study and administration approves, the class will be listed on the student’s transcript, receive credit, and be counted in class rank and GPA.

**COUNSELING SERVICES**

Upon entering Easton Area High School, students will be assigned to a counselor who will remain with them through the completion of their high school program. Counselors are assigned according to students' last names.

Students are encouraged to seek the guidance of their counselor as a primary source of assistance in helping them to arrive at solutions to problems. Counselors are prepared to assist a student with course selection, career planning, meeting and coping with personal problems, planning for post high school employment or education, etc. A counselor is willing to see a student at any time he/she is free and a student does not have a class.

Requests for appointments, aside from emergencies requiring immediate attention, will be honored during regularly scheduled study hall periods. Parents are encouraged to contact counselors any time they may have questions or concerns. Appointments may be arranged by contacting the Counseling Office at 610-250-2481, ext. 32011 or ext. 32018.

**NATIONAL HONOR SOCIETY (NHS)**

A student is selected for membership in the Easton chapter of the National Honor Society based on the following four tenets: scholarship, leadership, character, and service. To acquire membership, a student must have a grade point average of 90% for six consecutive marking periods. Once the student becomes a member they must maintain their membership by completing service hours, participating in group service projects, paying dues, and attending NHS meetings. Failure to meet annual requirements will result in an appearance before the five-member Faculty Council for a decision of probation or dismissal.

**PASS/FAIL OPTION**

Seniors only may opt to take a course on a pass/fail basis. Students and parents are reminded that only non-graduation credits may be taken on a pass/fail basis. Students are permitted to take only one course per year as a pass/fail course. The decision to take a course on a pass/fail basis must be made before the end of the first marking period for a semester course, and before the end of the first semester for a full year course.

No numerical grade will appear on the student’s report card. Students will receive a grade of P (PASS) or F (FAIL). A grade of 60 or above will warrant a P. A grade of 59 or below will result in the awarding of an F. Grades received will not be included in honor roll or in class rank computations. Full unit will be awarded at the end of the class. Students are expected to do all work that is required of individuals taking the class for a numerical grade.

**COLLEGE TESTING DATES**

Please check the College Board and ACT website for testing dates and details. These dates are subject to change without notice based on the discretion of College Board and ACT.

**SCHEDULE CHANGES OR WITHDRAWALS**

A concerted effort is made to accommodate each student’s course requests. Unfortunately, there are times when a student’s requests cannot be accommodated due to the number of sections available in a particular course or the periods a course is offered conflicting with another chosen selection.

Requests for schedule changes **MUST** be made within 8 school days of the start of each semester. Request forms are available online. Schedule changes or withdrawals (after the first 8 days) require administrative approval and will be considered for the following reasons **ONLY**:

- Clerical or computer error
- Student missing a required core class or lunch period
- Reassignment due to failure
- Diversified Occupations program – entering or withdrawing from the program
- CIT Requests – entering or withdrawing from the program
- Change in levels (example: Honors to CP) with teacher recommendation
- A student requesting a schedule change for academic reasons should first meet directly with their teacher to discuss academic concerns.
- Only after meeting with the teacher, counselor, and with parental approval, will the grade level principal review the request. Every effort must be made by the student to be academically successful.

Schedule changes **WILL NOT** be considered for the following reasons:

- To accommodate teacher preference
- Lateral move within the same subject area
- Change to obtain a preferred lunch period

*Note: Students **MUST** complete all courses in their entirety in order to receive course credit. If a student chooses to drop a full year class, or a class that has a lab in semester 2 he or she will receive no credit at the end of semester 1. If credit has been awarded for semester one, but the student drops or fails the course in semester 2, the semester 1 credit will be removed from the student’s transcript.*

**SCHOOL RECORD REQUESTS**

Upon request, Easton Area High School will forward an official copy of your high school transcript to the post high school institution or prospective employer you designate. Transcript requests can be made at [www.parchment.com](http://parchment.com/).

Parents may request to see their child's permanent school records. Such requests should be made to the child’s school counselor. Please refer to Policy #216 online at [www.eastonsd.org](http://www.eastonsd.org/)

**SENIOR PRIVILEGES**

Privileges to students must be considered as such – a privilege and not a right. Privileges are earned and privileges may be withdrawn from those students who do not accept the responsibilities of being a member of the student body. Students without privileges are not allowed to go off campus and must attend assigned study hall(s).

Privileges will be granted under the following criteria:

- Students are passing academically as indicated.
- Students maintain acceptable behavior as described in this handbook.

Senior privileges include off-campus lunch. Use of car for off campus lunch with parental permission only. Food may not be brought back on campus.

During the school year, privileges may be revoked for the following reasons:

1. Identified as failing one or more courses upon issuance of report cards
1. Identified as earning two or more unsatisfactory grades (below a 70) during the marking period
1. Unsatisfactory progress as determined by the parent(s) or guardian(s)
1. Four or more illegal-unexcused absences or unexcused tardies from school or class
1. Not adhering to rules and regulations of parking and/or driving violations
1. At administrative discretion

**SPECIAL EDUCATION**

Easton Area School District maintains an ongoing system to locate, identify, and evaluate students who are thought to be exceptional.

A parent may also request an evaluation as part of the child-find process. This request may be made in writing or verbally and should state the reason(s) why the parent feels the student may be in need of special education.

Information can be obtained from the school counselor in the student's school or the Special Education Office, Easton Area School District, Administration Office, 1801 Bushkill Drive, Easton, PA 18040. It is the intent of the district to ensure that students, who are disabled within the definition of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or Chapter 14 are identified, evaluated and provided with appropriate educational services.

It is the policy of the Board of Education to provide a free and appropriate public education to each disabled student within its jurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability.

**SUMMER SCHOOL**

A remedial summer school program is held at Easton Area High School for make-up of core academic courses previously failed. The courses being offered, fees, dates of summer school, and other pertinent details will be published and made available to students. Any student choosing not to attend summer school should be aware that graduation may be delayed. Regular attendance at summer school is required.

**TEXTBOOKS & iPADS**

The Easton Area School District provides students with textbooks, workbooks, paperbacks, and iPads. In the event books are lost, damaged, and/or defaced, students will be issued a second copy. The student must absorb the cost for the additional and/or damaged textbooks. Students that lose or damage their iPads and/or accessories are subject to the terms of the EASD iPad insurance plan. Students who declined insurance will be charged according to the fee schedule. A receipt must verify any monies paid. Students must return the textbook(s) that they were issued at the start of the school year/semester in the same condition at the end of the school year/semester. Students in grades 9-11 keep their iPad during the summer months.

**VALEDICTORIAN/SALUTATORIAN**

Determination of valedictorian and salutatorian are made at the conclusion of the third marking period of the senior year. The highest senior grade point average determines the identification of valedictorian. The second highest grade point average determines the identification of the salutatorian. Subsequent grades will be included for final rank but not for official determination of valedictorian or salutatorian.

**WITHDRAWAL PROCEDURE**

The grade level office must be notified if a student is transferring from the school district. The parent will be required to email the grade level office concerning their desire to withdraw from the Easton Area School District. The parent should include in the email the name and location of the school their child will be enrolled. The student must return all textbooks, iPad and accessories, and pay all financial obligations prior to being withdrawn. This should be done on or before the student’s last day of attendance.

**WORKING PAPERS**

Current students between the ages of 14-18 must apply for a work permit in the State of Pennsylvania. All applications are processed electronically and families will be contacted by Mrs. Negron by email with more details. The Work Permit Application can be found on the Easton Area High School website under “Students” or  “Parents”. You may need to request access to the online application. When the issuing officer is able to check their email, you will be granted access. Please be patient.

**ABSENCES AND ATTENDANCE**

**ABSENCES**

School attendance is important and is vital to student achievement. It is expected that every student will strive to be present each day. The responsibility for regular attendance rests with the student; however, the school and home share the responsibility to encourage students to attend school. The Commonwealth of PA (Ref: Pennsylvania School Code, Article XII, Section 1326) requires students to attend school regularly until they are eighteen. For those who are eighteen or older, regular attendance is also necessary to complete Easton Area High School requirements for graduation.

The Board requires that school-aged students enrolled in district schools attend school regularly, in accordance with state laws. The educational program offered by this district is predicated upon the presence of the student and requires continuity of instruction and classroom participation in order for students to achieve academic standards and consistent educational progress. Notice shall be provided to those parents/guardians who fail to comply with the statutory requirements of compulsory attendance that such infractions will be prosecuted according to law.

The Department of Education has ruled that the following are the only legal excuses for absences and tardiness:

1. Personal illness or illness in the immediate family
1. Death in the immediate family
1. Quarantine in the home
1. Impassable roads (determined by school)
1. Especially urgent reasons; “urgent” to be strictly constructed and interpreted by the school
1. Family/voluntary trips, in accordance with Board policy.

**ATTENDANCE**

The grade level office must receive parental notification (phone call or email) regarding the reason for the absence no later than 72 hours following the student’s return to school, or it will be recorded as an illegal absence. The grade level secretary reserves the right to confirm any appointments and excuses. All absences will be validated through an automated phone call generated by the school the day of the absence. This is a routine procedure to ensure maximum attendance. In the event of an absence of more than three (3) consecutive days, a doctor’s note is required upon returning to school. Failure to comply with this procedure will result in the student receiving an illegal absence.

The Board will recognize other justifiable absences for part of the school day. These shall include medical or dental appointments, court appearance, and family emergency. Furthermore, in some cases scheduled, extraordinary opportunities that the school cannot duplicate may provide students with valuable exposure and experiences. In all such cases, written request shall be made by the parent/guardian no less than 24 hours in advance. Requests must include the length and dates of the absence and will be reviewed for approval by building administration. An Attendance Request for Absence Form can be completed and submitted, no less than 24 hours in advance for such request. During such an excused absence, the student is required to complete coursework or credit or grade.

A maximum of ten (10) days of cumulative lawful absences verified by parental notification may be permitted during a school year. Absences beyond the ten (10) cumulative days will require an excuse from a physician. All doctor’s excuses are subject to review and verification by the grade level principal. When an absence is legal, the frequency of absences is still a concern. Therefore, when a student accumulates excessive absences, additional administrative contact may be made with the parent/guardian and/or medical professional verification may be required.

**HOMELESS STUDENTS – POLICY #251**

The Easton Area School District has an ongoing obligation to remove barriers to the enrollment and retention of homeless children and youth. The McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act states that homeless children and youth must be enrolled in school immediately, even if the child or youth has missed application or enrollment deadlines during any period of homelessness.

The McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act includes a focus and emphasis on:

- Increased identification, enrollment, stability and school success
- Preschool-aged children
- Collaboration and coordination with other service providers
- Removing enrollment barriers
- Privacy of student records
- Dispute resolution process (See Policy 251)

**CLASS ATTENDANCE**

All students are expected to be in their assigned areas on time. Anyone in the hallways after the bell for the start of class must have signed out via e-hallpass.  Illegal absence from school or class may result in the student not being able to make up missed work. Continued absences from class and/or school could impact student achievement and overall connectedness to school. The school must make meaningful attempts to engage the parent/guardian and student in a Student Attendance Improvement Plan to address individual student needs and partner with the family for student success. It should be understood that students who have an illegal absence may receive no credit for that day’s work, which may include a missed test.

**ABSENCE DURING FINAL AND AP EXAMS**

If, due to illness, a student is unable to come to school during an assigned final and/or AP exam period, it is necessary that the grade level office be contacted prior to the start of the examination the day of the exam; and followed up with a doctor’s excuse or parental note verifying the illness. All unexcused absences will result in no credit for the exam grade. Any other reasons for not attending an examination must be cleared, in advance, with the head or grade level principal. Failure to comply with this procedure will result in the absence being designated as unexcused and the student will not be allowed to make up the examination.

**COLLEGE VISITS**

Seniors are allowed five (5) days for college visits. Juniors are allowed three (3) days. The school acknowledges college visits as excused days of absenteeism, upon verification of the visit from the college. A request for a college visit must be given to the grade level principal three (3) school days in advance of the visit. Upon return, the student must present proof of visit on college letterhead from the Admissions Office.

**FAMILY TRIPS**

A student may miss no more than five (5) total “trip days” other than those in which the student is representing the high school in a competition. A request for a “family trip” approval must be given to the grade level principal five (5) school days in advance of the trip. If prior approval is not granted for a trip, all days missed will be unexcused. No work will be permitted to be made up.

The following criteria will be considered when approving a family trip:

1. Recognized at the discretion of the grade level principal.
1. Student must be in good standing, regarding attendance, discipline and academics (must have at least a 60% in each course).
1. Student must consult with teachers before leaving regarding assignments.
1. Any make-up work requiring teacher assistance must be arranged by the student with the individual teacher(s) upon return from the trip.
1. No trips will be authorized during exams.

*No family trips will be approved during scheduled state testing.*

**REQUEST FOR EXCUSAL**

If a parent or guardian wishes to request excusal for their child for reasons not provided for in the school code (special emergencies, etc.) a written request should be addressed to the grade level principal prior to the child leaving school. A decision will be made based on the student’s academic and behavioral records before approval is granted. Students will only be released to individuals in PowerSchool.

**RETURNING TO SCHOOL AFTER ABSENCE**

It is the student’s responsibility to schedule make-up work with individual teachers when returning from an excused absence. Any attempt to avoid procedural rules of attendance to cover-up class cuts or unexcused absences will result in disciplinary action. A student has 72 hours from the time of absence to have any unexcused absence converted to an excused one via a valid verification.

**LATE FOR SCHOOL/CLASS**

In order to ensure student success, students need to arrive at school and class on time. If a student is not present at the scheduled time, they will be marked tardy. If a student is late to school, they must bring in a note to the Attendance Office indicating the reason for tardiness. Upon administrative discretion, attendance will be reflected accordingly.

Students arriving after 7:20 AM, without an excuse, will be escorted to class by school personnel. Students will remain in the auditorium until school personnel are available.  Excessive tardiness to school will result in disciplinary consequences.

**ILLEGAL OR UNEXCUSED ABSENCE & CLASS CUTS**

Absences from school or class result in missed instructional time. Continued class cutting or absences will impact student success and academic progress. Students who establish a history of absences (excused or illegal) may be required to produce medical verification for subsequent absences.

**APPOINTMENT PROCEDURES**

The school realizes that there are occasions when parents will find it necessary to request permission for their child to leave the building to keep an urgent medical appointment during the school day. Most medical appointments can and should be made for after-school hours. However, if it is not possible to schedule an appointment for after school hours, then the following procedure should be adhered to:

- Parent must notify the grade level office via email or phone call including the reason, time, date, and place of the appointment.
- If permission is granted to leave the building, the student’s teacher will be notified by the grade level office. At the stated time, the student should report to the front desk security. When the parent/guardian arrives to pick up the student, the parent/guardian will sign the child out of the building at the front desk security, and will be asked to provide identification - driver’s license or valid PA photo ID.
- If returning to school the same day of the appointment, the student must report to the Attendance Office prior to going to class to receive a pass for admission to class.
- When the appointment is for a doctor or dentist, an excuse from the doctor or dentist’s office must be turned into the Attendance Office when the student returns to school. The student must scan out and in when they return from the appointment. Failure to return the excuse to the office within three days will result in a half or full day of unexcused absence, depending on the time of the scheduled appointment.

**STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES**

1. Student responsibilities include regular school attendance, conscientious effort in classroom work and conformance to school rules and regulations. Most of all, students share with the administration and faculty a responsibility to develop a climate within the school that is conducive to learning.
1. No student has the right to interfere with the education of his/her fellow students. It is the responsibility of each student to respect the rights of teachers, students, administrators and all others who are involved in the educational process.
1. Students should express their ideas and opinions in a respectful manner.
1. It is the responsibility of the students to conform to the following:
- Adhere to all rules and regulations for student behavior as outlined in the EAHS Student Parent Handbook and Code of Conduct.
- Report information in matters relating to the health, safety and welfare of the school community and the protection of school property.

- Be familiar with the Easton Area School District Internet and Network and copyright policies.

**ACTIVITY ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION**

All co-curricular and curricular activities are an integral part of the overall educational approach of the high school. An opportunity to participate in athletic and non-athletic activities is a vital part of the school’s philosophy. Representing the school and community on the field of athletic competition or through a performing group or club carries with it an important responsibility. The image of our school and the community it represents is conveyed by the actions of the students.

Students must have an excused absence and arrive to school prior to 10:45 am in order to participate in the scheduled event.

**ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION**

Alternative Education programs within the Easton Area School District provide an increased service environment to students at-risk for school dropout and those not maximizing their potential for school success. Such students may be in need of a more individualized and supportive approach to their schooling.

Reasons for referral to alternative education programs:

(Title 24-Article XIX-C of Pennsylvania School Code)

1. Disregard for school authority, including persistent violation of school policy and rules
1. Display or use of controlled substances on school property or during school-affiliated activities
1. Violent or threatening behavior on school property or during school-affiliated activities
1. Possession of a weapon on school property, as defined under 18 Pa. C.S. Section 912 (relating to possession of weapon on school property)
1. Commission of a criminal act on school property or during school-affiliated activities
1. Misconduct that would merit suspension or expulsion under school policy

For more information, please visit the Pennsylvania Department of Education website.

**ASSEMBLIES**

Students are to enter the auditorium in an orderly fashion and fill in the rows in the auditorium from front to back. Students are expected to remain seated at all times and to be attentive and respectful to the speaker.

**ATHLETIC ELIGIBILITY**

P.I.A.A. regulations state that a student must be passing four full-credit subjects (or the equivalent in block scheduling) in order to participate in interscholastic sports. Specific attendance and academic eligibility requirements can be found on the PIAA website ([www.piaa.org](http://www.piaa.org)). The EAHS eligibility ratio is the following (course/pass):  3c/2p; 4c/3p, 5c/3p; 6c/4p; 7c/5p; 8c/5p.

**ATHLETICS**

The opportunity to represent your school and community through participation in interscholastic athletics is a privilege and an integral part in American education. Participation in interscholastic athletics offers lifetime learning experiences that are unduplicated in other areas of the educational program.

The purpose of each of the interscholastic athletic sports programs is to help develop an appreciation for a spirit of competitiveness, cooperative effort, and drive to win fairly.

**DISCIPLINARY ACTION**

Disciplinary action taken by the school is intended to improve the student’s attitude and extinguish subsequent behavior. The disciplinary process available to the school is regulated by law and district policy. Consistency of action in a large school is of great concern. The consistency of any action is governed by the following three considerations: (1) the objective sought in a case to help the student, (2) the nature of the student's previous behavior record; discipline records are cumulative from freshman year through senior year, and (3) stated policy or precedent based on previous action.

We expect responsible behavior from students. Ignorance of school rules is no excuse for misbehavior. It is the student's responsibility to know that which he/she can and cannot do. When in doubt, the student should ask an adult.

**EXPLANATION OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION![](Aspose.Words.c8e98ed9-c8fc-408f-b6d8-ac828b163a8f.003.png)**

**Denial of Senior Privilege** - Privileges must be earned. They may be withdrawn for improper behavior. The length of such denial depends on the nature of the infraction and the previous behavior record of the student. Privileges can be denied from one day to the entire year depending on the circumstances.

**Verbal Warning** will be given before stronger disciplinary action is taken.

**In-School Suspension** - is temporary exclusion from class and all school related activities. Those who are suspended in school will stay in an assigned area under supervision. Parents will be notified by mail and by telephone. Immediately upon arrival, cell phones or electronic devices must be turned over to the in-school suspension proctor. Refusal to turn a cell phone or electronic device over may result in a detention and/or an out of school suspension. Suspension is usually taken when other alternatives have been exhausted or the infraction stipulates suspension as the punishment.

**Out of School Suspension** - is temporary exclusion from school and all school related activities for serious and/or repeated violations of the rules. The length of a suspension may be from one to ten days depending on the nature of the infraction and previous behavior. Parents will be notified by mail and by telephone. Suspension is usually taken when other alternatives have been exhausted or the infraction stipulates suspension as the punishment. Students who are out of school suspended are not permitted to be on school grounds and participate in any school activities during their suspension. Suspended students found on campus during their suspension will face defiant trespass charges.

**Detention** - Detentions are used for purposes such as tardiness to school, habitual tardiness to class, and other Level I infractions.

**Expulsion** - is exclusion from school by the Board of Education for a period exceeding ten (10) days and may be permanent expulsion from the school rolls. A recommendation for expulsion is made by the high school principal to the Superintendent. The Board of Education makes the final decision. Please refer to Policy #233 online at[ www.eastonsd.org](http://www.eastonsd.org) for further information.

**BUS CONDUCT**

Being transported by Easton Area School District transportation is a privilege, not a right. The district must assure that proper conduct is maintained in all vehicles for the health, safety, and welfare of the students. Proper conduct on the bus is the responsibility of the student. The driver is in complete charge of the bus. Students who risk the safety of others by their misbehavior may lose the privilege of riding the bus.

Students being transported are expected to adhere to the following Code of Conduct and Safety:

- Arrive at the assigned bus stop approximately five minutes prior to pick up.
- Wait to board when the bus has come to a complete stop.
- Board and depart the bus in an orderly and safe manner - single file.
- Ride only on the bus assigned - boarding and departing at the designated stop.
- Maintain a safe condition within the bus at all times.
- Do not extend hands, arms, etc., or objects out of windows or door or throw objects from bus.
- Use of obscene language is not permitted.
- Musical instruments are not permitted unless carried in a case secured in a safe place.
- Eating and drinking is not permitted on the bus.
- Obey the school bus driver at all times. In case of emergency, remain on the bus unless directed to do otherwise by the driver or individual in authority.
- Students who damage seats or other parts of the bus will be required to pay for their replacement and may face criminal charges.
- Students are to remain in their seats upon entering the bus until they are designated to depart the bus by the driver.
- The district reserves the right to establish any other rules and regulations that protect the health, safety, and welfare of the students.
- Students are not permitted to have tobacco or smoking paraphernalia in any form in their possession while on school district transportation. Please refer to Policy# 222 online at [www.eastonsd.org ](http://www.eastonsd.org/)for further information.

If a student violates any of the above rules/regulations and loses their bus privilege, the student or his/her parents/guardians will be responsible for transportation to and from school. Even though bus privileges are lost, the law still requires attendance at school per the student attendance policy.

Unusual and extreme misbehavior may result in formal criminal charges being brought against the student(s) relating to harassment, disorderly conduct, criminal mischief, and/or criminal trespass.

When the bus driver submits a misconduct report to the building/assistant principal, the protocol is as follows:

- Building/assistant principal gives verbal warning and/or disciplinary action to student.
- Second offense is a letter of warning sent to parent(s) that a bus suspension may occur on the next offense as determined by the building/assistant principal.
- Third, fourth and fifth offense may result in a suspension from the bus. The building/assistant principal will determine the number of days suspended off of the bus.
- Sixth offense could result in permanent expulsion from being transported on a district vehicle.
- The administration reserves the right, depending on the seriousness of the offense, to move to any step in the process.

**CAFETERIA**

Easton Area High School has four 39-minute lunch periods. The following guidelines will lead to an orderly lunch period:

- **NO FOOD IS TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE CAFETERIA BY STUDENTS WITHOUT WRITTEN PERMISSION. STAFF MEMBERS GIVING WRITTEN PERMISSION MUST SUPERVISE THESE STUDENTS UPON THEIR RETURN.**
- Students may report to lockers on the way to the cafeteria, or upon leaving the cafeteria on the way to class. Students who are considered late to lunch (no more than 5 minutes after the bell) may face disciplinary action.
- Upon finishing their lunches, students dispose of their trash and return to their tables. Students are responsible for keeping their tables and table area clean. If students refuse to clean their table or table area, they will be held responsible. If the specific individuals cannot be determined then the entire table will be held responsible for any disciplinary action.
- The lunch proctor will dismiss students by table at the end of the lunch period.
- NO GAMBLING ALLOWED.
- Electronic devices ARE PERMITTED in the cafeteria; however, MUSIC can only be played with headphones/earphones.
- TAKING PICTURES OR VIDEOS WITH ANY ELECTRONIC DEVICE IS STRICTLY

PROHIBITED.

- Food from outside vendors is NOT permitted to be dropped off or delivered to the school during the school day.
- The throwing of food may result in disciplinary action.
- Seniors with privileges who choose not to leave campus must eat in the cafeteria and be on time.
- Students that attend Career Institute of Technology are required to eat at C.I.T. and may not enter the cafeteria during lunch periods.

Easton Area High School will participate in the National School Lunch Program/School Breakfast Program under guidelines established by the Easton Area School District. Individuals interested in participating in the program must secure and complete the application for Free and Reduced Meals.

**CARD PLAYING OR GAMBLING**

No card playing of any kind is allowed anywhere in school or on the school campus. Gambling of any type is not permitted. No dice or other gambling paraphernalia are permitted in school or on the school campus. Items will be confiscated and disciplinary action may follow.

**DISRESPECT TO OTHERS**

Students who exhibit physical or verbal abuse to school authority or who commit immoral acts or gestures and who make salacious statements either verbally or in writing will be dealt with as the degree of student involvement warrants. Threats upon school district employees (in school or outside of school) or fellow students may result in immediate suspension and criminal charges (fine, imprisonment or both). Disrespect of a lesser degree, insubordination to an employee's directive may warrant verbal reprimand, detention, or suspension. The following behaviors may result in a suspension and may include a citation for disorderly conduct:  swearing at teachers, obscene gestures, and/or defiance.

**DRESS CODE**

This dress code has been adopted in accordance with Board Policy 221, related to dress and grooming. The following rules shall apply to student dress, and students violating this dress code shall be subject to disciplinary action. All provisions apply equally to male and female students.

1. ALL STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR OR BE ABLE TO PRESENT THEIR STUDENT ID UPON REQUEST.
1. **In an effort to keep students safe, no head coverings of any kind will be permitted during the school day, including, but not limited to bandanas, durags, bonnets, hats, hoods, ski masks, etc. (unless worn for religious or medical reasons and in that case documentation must be on file in the grade level office). This applies to both men and women.**
1. No clothing imprinted with nudity, vulgarity, obscenity, profanity, and pictures or slogans, including those relating to alcohol, tobacco, drugs, weapons and violent acts.
1. No clothing that inappropriately displays the anatomy.
1. No see-through garments without appropriate undergarments. See-through garments may be worn only if worn over items of clothing that comply with the dress code.

9. No sunglasses worn inside the school building unless medically necessary as documented by a physician.
9. Clothing or personal effects not specifically listed are subject to administrative review.

School staff have the right to enforce all of the above restrictions.

Parents should understand that they might be asked to bring a change of clothing to school for students who are in violation of this policy. School officials may impose limitations on student participation in the regular instructional program where there is evidence that inappropriate dress causes disruption in the classroom, and the lack of cleanliness constitutes a health hazard or disruption of the educational program. Students have the responsibility to dress appropriately and to keep themselves, their clothes, and their hair clean.

**DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE**

Students suspected of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol during school hours or at any school-sponsored activity will be investigated in order to determine the cause of the unusual behavior or conditions. The student will be assessed by the school nurse. Refusal to be assessed by the school nurse will result in disciplinary action. The principal will review the entire incident and make subsequent recommendations accordingly, including referral to the SAP team to determine a further course of action. The student will comply with the recommendations of the team. Parents will be contacted. If the school is formally advised by medical authorities and/or police officials that the student was, in fact, under the influence of drugs, the head principal, and/or his assistants, will immediately suspend the student out of school and recommend that the child is assessed for drug and alcohol concerns by Recovery Revolutions.

Any student selling, distributing, arranging for or participating in the purchase, giving away or receiving any amount of marijuana, illegal drugs, illegally acquired drugs, drug paraphernalia, alcohol, or any substance alleged to be one of the aforementioned on school property or at any school-sponsored activity may be recommended for expulsion by the principal. Parents and police will be contacted to be apprised of the situation and the student will be referred for a drug and alcohol assessment.

Any student possessing (on self or school property or at a school-sponsored activity) any amount of marijuana, illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, alcohol, or any substance alleged to be one of the aforementioned, will be suspended  and a possible recommendation for expulsion. Parents and police will be contacted to be apprised of the situation. The principal will review the entire incident and make subsequent recommendations accordingly and make referrals to the SAP team to determine a further course of action.

Should a student be convicted of any drug or alcohol related offense taking place off school property and after school hours, he/she may be interviewed by the principal to determine the role to be taken by the school, including referral to the SAP team to determine a further course of action.

Be assured that any student whose presence, in the opinion of the principal, constitutes a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the students and/or interferes with the educational process of the school can reasonably expect to be recommended for expulsion.

**ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION DEVICES: CELL PHONES,**

**LASER LIGHT POINTERS, AND OTHER STUDENT ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION DEVICES**

Unauthorized use of cell phones, laser light pointers, and other student electronic communication devices are grounds for confiscation of the device by school officials and may result in disciplinary action.

**EXTORTION AND THEFT**

Those found responsible for extortion or stealing may be suspended or charged by the police. The policy on theft is designed not only to warn or deter students, but also to punish those responsible for theft, however small, to the fullest extent possible.

1. Theft is to be reported to the proper authorities.
1. Depending on the student's behavior record and/or previous record of theft, the school may recommend expulsion.
1. If the item stolen cannot be recovered or is damaged, the student responsible for the theft is responsible for restitution.

Students will use their EASD device to initiate a pass. Faculty/staff will digitally approve student passes. Faculty/staff members must ensure that all students utilize the e-hallpass system process when leaving room. Students are expected to follow e-hallpass guidelines and procedures outlined by building administration.

**UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT/SEXUAL HARASSMENT**

The Easton Area School District seeks to establish and maintain an educational climate for students and employees and a safe and supportive school environment. Members of the school community are expected to treat each other with mutual respect and to accept the rich diversity.

It shall be a violation of the Unlawful Harassment/Sexual Harassment Policy #248 for any member of the Easton Area School District staff to harass another staff member or student through conduct or communications of an unlawful nature as defined in Section II. It shall also be a violation of this policy for students to harass other students through conduct or communications of an unlawful nature as defined in Section II.

Violations of the policy which, in the judgment of the investigating school official, may also constitute a violation of the harassment or stalking provisions of Section 2709 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, shall be referred to the appropriate law enforcement agency for investigation. Please refer to Policy #103 online at [www.eastonsd.org](http://www.eastonsd.org/). 

Harassment is unwanted and unwelcome sexual behavior which interferes with your right to get an education or to participate in school activities. It may result from words or conduct that offend, stigmatize or demean a student.

The target of the harassment and the perpetrator do not have to agree about what is happening; harassment is subjective. Nor do you have to get others, whether your peers or school officials, to agree with you. Harassment can be a one-time occurrence or multiple occurrences. Some forms of harassment are also crimes and will be reported to police for investigation.

**IDENTIFICATION CARDS**

Easton Area High School students are required to be in possession of their identification card provided for all students. The following guidelines will be enforced:

In the event of a single day absence on the date of a preannounced test, project, or other assignment, the work must be completed or submitted on the date of return to school.

Students must complete all make-up work within the allotted time. In the event of extenuating circumstances, extensions may be granted by the administration upon review.

**SCHOOL INSURANCE**

The Easton Area School District will cooperate with a private insurance firm in offering students a low-cost insurance program. Students who want to participate in this insurance may download the flyer directly from the Bollinger Specialty Group website [www.BollingerSchools.com](http://www.bollingerschools.com).

In general, policies provide protection for medical, surgical, and dental expenses resulting from school injuries which are in excess of any benefits provided by each participant's family hospitalization insurance (Blue Shield, Blue Cross, etc.).

All students are encouraged to participate in the school insurance program.

**LEAVING CAMPUS/BUILDING**

Once a student arrives on campus they are not permitted to leave the building or school grounds without specific permission from the principal or assistant principal. Any student violating this policy will receive a **1 day out of school suspension.** This includes retrieving something from a student’s vehicle.  Students who choose to leave campus and return may be subject to a search by school administration. Students who are off campus may be stopped and have ID's checked by the police and/or security staff. Those without proper identification will be returned to the high school and incur

disciplinary action.

**LIBRARY PROCEDURE**

The high school library serves as a place for students to complete their immediate and long-term assignments. The library staff wishes to provide an atmosphere that is conducive to learning and supportive of intellectual curiosity. It is a place for academic research and study where a variety of materials and services are provided to support curriculum and to help foster a lifelong interest in acquiring knowledge. Easton Area High School library provides staff and students with state-of-the-art resources such as: Access PA, computerized databases, college and career materials, books, periodicals, and photocopies.

Students should request a pass from their teacher. Students that are in a study hall should check in with their study hall teacher first for attendance. Study hall teachers will put the time on the pass after checking in. Books are circulated for three (3) weeks with the option of renewal if another person has not requested the books. There is no fine for overdue books. Students who have lost or damaged materials need to pay replacement costs.

General rules for the library are as follows:

1. No food or drink is permitted in the library.
1. Student ID is required to check books out.
1. Theft of library materials may result in suspension.
1. The library is open 7:10 a.m. – 2:30 p.m.

Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:10 a.m. – 4:00 p.m.

**LITTERING**

Littering in and/or outside the building may result in disciplinary action. The building and campus must be kept clean and free of litter.

**LOCKERS**

Students will be assigned a locker, upon request, by their grade level office. Students are responsible for any damages.

1. Lockers may be used at any time during the day.
1. Lockers are to be used for storage of clothes, books and other items necessary for school activities.

1. Students shall not expect privacy regarding items placed in school lockers; school property is subject to search at any time by school officials. When school authorities have a reasonable suspicion that the locker contains material, which pose a threat to the health, welfare and safety of students in the school, student lockers may be searched without prior warning.
8. The principal can make a request for the drug-sniffing dog through the local police department.

School officials may conduct periodic or sweeping searches of all lockers. At the end of every school year students must remove all items from their lockers by the specified date.

**LOST AND FOUND**

The lost and found is located in the cafeteria. Students finding lost articles should bring them to the Main Office. Valuables such as rings, eyeglasses, wallets, etc. are kept separately and secured. Items will be held until the end of the school year.

**LYING**

Honesty is important for the integrity of the student to administrator relationship. Students who are honest are given consideration when determining disciplinary action. Dishonesty found to be evident through an investigation wastes valuable resources and time and will not be tolerated. Disciplinary action could be assigned in such cases. Lying to protect oneself or others may result in disciplinary action, including suspension.

**MEDICAL ROOM POLICY**

The nurses’ offices at EAHS are located in Room D112 by the main gym for grades 9 and 10, and Room C203 by the cafeteria for grades 11 and 12.  There is a Certified School Nurse in charge of each health room office.  The EASD school physician visits the school periodically to provide school physicals with parental permission to students in 10th/11th grade. St. Luke’s Primary Care Sports Medicine gives physical exams to members of the school’s athletic teams with parental permission.

Students with medical conditions that require accommodations such as elevator keys, early release passes, student escorts, medication administration, etc. should provide that written directive from their healthcare provider.  Elevator keys are obtained through the Security Office and require a $5.00 deposit.

Students must utilize e-hallpass to visit the nurses’ offices. Emergencies are accepted at any time. Students are not to stop in the Health Room between classes as this may result in an unexcused tardy to class.

Students need to be assessed by the nurse to be excused from school. In order to be excused to go home, the nurse must be able to reach a parent or another person in PowerSchool.  If a parent or designee is not available, a parent may give permission for an alternate person having appropriate ID to pick up their student.  Students are not allowed to call or text parents in order to be released.  After assessment by the nurse, if it is found that the student is to be sent home, the nurse’s office will notify the grade level secretary.

An excuse from a health care provider is required for an extended release from physical education classes,  and the provider must also give permission for athletic participation to any pupil with a known physical condition.

If your grade level nurse’s office is closed during an emergency, go to the other nurse’s office.

**MEDICATION POLICY**

If a student needs to take medication in school, whether it is prescription or certain over-the-counter medications, the procedure is as follows:

1. Complete and return EASD’s Medication Authorization Form that provides the nurse with doctor’s prescription and parent/guardian permission to administer the medication. This form can be found on our school district’s website under Parents & Community/Health Services/Medication or in the nurse’s office.
1. Bring the medication in its original container to the nurse’s office.  Students may not transport medication to school per district policy.
1. Parents will be notified to refill the supply of medication in school as needed, and will receive notification at the end of the year to pick up any remaining medication at designated times and dates.
1. At the high school level, a Standing Medication Authorization form is available for administration of Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, and Benadryl.  With a signed parental consent students have the opportunity to take the above medications up to three times per month.  The Standing Medication Order is available in the nurse's office.

**PARKING AND TRAFFIC REGULATIONS**

Easton Area High School has designated reserved parking areas for students, teachers and other school employees. Parking is a privilege that must be earned. Empty parking spaces do not warrant a student parking on campus without permission.

In order to park on campus, students must secure a parking space tag. A non-refundable fee will be assessed for the tag. Students will be required to park only in areas assigned for student parking. Easton Area High School and the Easton Area School District assume no responsibility for vehicles or personal property. Students with Easton Area High School issued parking tags are permitted to park at their own risk. Any incidents of vandalism or physical damage and/or theft must be handled through the student and/or parent’s personal auto or homeowner’s insurance. Easton Area High School and the Easton Area School District does not provide secure parking at any time.

When all spaces are allotted, no more tags will be issued. In the event a tag is lost, a new tag must be secured and a $5.00 replacement fee paid.

- Observe and practice the 15 M.P.H. speed limit on school grounds.
- Park only in designated student parking lots.
- No parking is permitted in the main driveway; this is for visitors and handicapped parking only.
- Park in legal spaces only - do not block stairways leading to the parking lots or park on the grass, etc.
- Observe all safety regulations.
- Parking tags must be placed on the inside rearview mirror with the tag clearly visible.
- Parking tags are not transferable from one student to another.
- Parking off campus in surrounding neighborhoods or business establishments is prohibited. **Cars** **parked in these areas are towed at the owner’s expense.**

Students are not to loiter in or use parking lot areas for any purpose unless the area is designated for specific recreation. Students are not to sit in their cars during school hours.

Failure to abide by these rules may result in the withdrawal of the privilege of parking or driving on school property, and the loss of all privileges, and a possible fine.

**RESTROOMS**

The school will make every attempt to keep restrooms clean and functioning as well as maintain the proper supplies for your use. Please help us keep these areas clean and as pleasant as possible. Smoking, writing on walls and partitions, and other acts that damage property make the restrooms unpleasant and may result in disciplinary action and criminal charges. Any student feeling ill must report to the nurse’s office. Use of the restrooms for this purpose will not be accepted as an excuse for missed class(es).

No more than one person is to occupy a toilet cubicle at any time. If a person or more than one person is in a toilet cubicle and smoke/smell or suspicion to indicate smoking/vaping/juuling is or has taken place, all individuals in the cubicle will be considered in violation of the smoking policy. Violation of this rule may result in disciplinary action.

Restrooms will remain locked until 7:30 AM after the start of block one when students may obtain permission and properly sign out via e-hallpass.

**STUDENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SAP)**

The Easton Area School District values each member of its school community and believes that all individuals have the right to develop to their fullest potential. We recognize that chemical abuse and dependency as well as other risky behaviors seriously impair the ability of individuals to achieve that success. Behaviors that put students at-risk include chemical abuse, drinking alcohol, eating disorders, social and emotional problems have an adverse effect on the ability of all members of the school community to achieve personal and district educational goals. The Student Assistance Program (SAP) is based on the belief that chemical dependency is a life-threatening illness that impacts the emotional, physical, intellectual, and social development of all individuals. Because it is also our conviction that these behaviors are treatable, the Easton Area School District has adopted the following policy:

The Student Assistance Program is a way to identify students at-risk who are having challenges in school, and refer them for help. It is an intervention, not a treatment. The heart of the program is the Student Assistance Team, a core group of school personnel who are specially trained to identify and work with these students. The SAP team at Easton Area High School functions with a team approach to link school and community resources to students and families. Many issues create barriers to a child’s success including, but not limited to, mental health concerns, drug and alcohol concerns, home and environmental factors. The SAP team serves to identify the areas that are impacting a student’s success and explore interventions to target these barriers.

The Easton Area High School Support Team is composed of faculty and school administrators trained in the process of identifying and documenting behaviors of at-risk students. It is considered a helping mechanism, which works within the structure of the school's disciplinary system to provide a response to the problems of adolescents in school that are a direct manifestation of the students' lifestyles.

The process begins with a referral that identifies the problem behavior. The referral is sent to the core team, and information is gathered from a survey in order to distinguish between adolescent problems, which can be resolved internally, through a team-based discussion based on identified student needs.

SAP does not diagnose students but rather assesses behavioral patterns. This information is presented to the student and family for consideration of the best course of intervention. Finally, support and follow up are completed by the core team to understand the effectiveness of the interventions.

**SMOKING**

Students are not permitted to have tobacco or smoking paraphernalia in any form in their possession while on school grounds, at school sponsored activities, or on school sponsored transportation. Tobacco and tobacco smoking paraphernalia includes a lighted or unlighted cigarette, pipe, or other lighted smoking product, and smokeless tobacco in any form. This would also include other smoking devices such as E-cigarettes, vape or dab pens, or vaporizers. Any student seen or caught using any tobacco smoking device in any form will face disciplinary action up to and including suspension from school. Student smoking or use of smokeless tobacco is not permitted anywhere in school or on school grounds outside the building. If a student or more than one student is in a restroom or a toilet cubicle, all students shall be considered in violation of the no smoking policy unless the smoker(s) identifies himself/herself. Lookouts or those warning or protecting smokers may receive disciplinary action.

Additionally, any student who uses cigarettes, e-cigarettes, vapes or Juuls in school, at any school activity or event or anywhere on our campus will receive disciplinary action.

**SMOKING OFFENSES**

A smoking offense may result in a suspension, in addition to penalties under Act 145 of the School Tobacco Control of Pennsylvania. Act 145 of 1996 amends the Crimes Code to include language-prohibiting students from possessing or using tobacco in a school building, a school bus or on school property. School districts are granted the authority to initiate prosecution for any such offense. Upon conviction, a student will be found guilty of a summary offense and subject to a fine of up to $50.00 plus court costs. The court may admit the student to an adjudication alternative in lieu of the fine. Such a summary offense is not reportable as a criminal act.

Amending Title 18 (Crimes and Offenses) of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, further providing for deceptive business practices; AND PROHIBITING USE OF TOBACCO IN SCHOOLS. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows: SECTION 2. TITLE 18 IS AMENDED BY ADDING A SECTION TO READ: **§** **6306.1. *USE*** ***OF TOBACCO IN SCHOOLS PROHIBITED. (A) OFFENSE DEFINED - A PUPIL WHO POSSESSES OR USES TOBACCO IN A SCHOOL BUILDING, A SCHOOL BUS OR ON SCHOOL PROPERTY OWNED BY, LEASED BY OR UNDER THE CONTROL OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT COMMITS A SUMMARY OFFENSE.***

At the end of the suspension period, the student and the parent(s)/guardian(s) may be responsible for paying restitution for the damages.

**VISITORS**

All visitors will enter the building via the main entrance to the building, and must report to the front desk security upon entering the building and obtain a visitor’s pass.

In addition to the items enumerated above, weapons defined in Pennsylvania Statute Title 18, Easton Area School District Policy also included items such as mace, pepper spray, and/or other items capable of inflicting serious bodily injury. Students in violation of the school district’s Weapons Policy will be subject to discipline and may incur criminal charges.

A student possessing a weapon on school grounds, at any school-sponsored activity, or on school buses will be subject to a disciplinary action including suspension and/or expulsion.

The Easton Area School District reserves the right to periodically conduct weapon searches of the entire school population of a building. In the interest of providing a safe learning environment, students may be subject to a search upon arriving on the school campus or entering the building.

School personnel and/or police officials will conduct the searches. Students will be required to stand in a line before a table and empty their pockets while their backpacks, coats, purses, etc. are searched. Handheld metal scanners may be utilized in the search. In the event the search area becomes too crowded, students will be chosen at random, or be checked before disembarking from school buses. This procedure extends to students entering the building for activities such as dances and other extracurricular activities.

Anyone desiring to anonymously report a safety concern or hazard which may jeopardize the safety of others, the Easton Area School District, its students or employees, should direct his or her correspondence to the respective building principal or the Office of the Superintendent if applicable.

**Letter from the Superintendent and Board President**

August 2022

Welcome to the new school year!

We are pleased to share our Easton Area School District Code of Conduct with you. The Code of Conduct is reviewed on an annual basis by the administrative team. These individuals will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the implementation of the Code of Conduct through varied stakeholders: parents, students, teachers and administrators.

There are some very important inclusions to the Code of Conduct:

1. Board policies are referenced throughout this document. The full policies can be found online at [www.eastonsd.org](http://www.eastonsd.org) or you may request copies from your building principal.
1. Responsibilities of students, parents/guardians, faculty/staff and administrators are clearly stated.
1. Charts make it clearer to see what consequences are imposed when the Code of Conduct is not followed. These charts cover the four levels of infractions.

A safe and productive learning environment is important for the success of our students and our schools. It is important that we work together to ensure that safety. This occurs through cooperation from all students, parents, guardians, administrators, teachers, support staff and the community at large to enforce the Code of Conduct. We also appreciate our many community partners who contribute to the safety of our schools in the community. We wish everyone a safe and productive school year!

Mr. David F. Piperato Mrs. Jodi Hess *Superintendent of Schools EASD School Board President*
